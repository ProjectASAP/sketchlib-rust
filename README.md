`sketchlib-rust` is a Rust sketch library with reusable sketch building blocks, sketch implementations, and orchestration frameworks.

## Supported Sketches

| Goal | Use This | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency estimation | `CountMin`, `Count Sketch` | You need fast approximate counts for high-volume keys. |
| Cardinality estimation | `HyperLogLog` (`Regular`, `DataFusion`, `HIP`) | You need approximate distinct counts with bounded memory. |
| Quantiles/distribution | `KLL`, `DDSketch` | You need percentile/latency summaries over streams. |
| Multi-sketch orchestration/windowing | `Hydra`, `UnivMon`, `HashLayer`, `ExponentialHistogram`, `EHUnivOptimized`, `NitroBatch`, `Orchestrator` | You need hierarchical queries, sketch coordination, or sliding-window aggregation. |

Full sketch status and API details: [APIs Index](./docs/apis.md).

## Quick Start

Simple demo use case: estimate unique users with HyperLogLog.

```rust
use sketchlib_rust::{DataFusion, HyperLogLog, SketchInput};

fn main() {
    let mut hll = HyperLogLog::<DataFusion>::new();

    for user_id in 0..10_000u64 {
        hll.insert(&SketchInput::U64(user_id));
    }

    let approx_unique_users = hll.estimate();
    println!("approx unique users = {}", approx_unique_users);
}
```

To validate the repo quickly:

```bash
cargo test
```

Common dev commands:

```bash
cargo build --all-targets
cargo test --all-features
cargo bench
```

## Why sketchlib-rust (vs Apache DataSketches)

- Native Rust library: no JNI/FFI bridge needed for Rust services.
- Rust-first API surface: typed inputs (`SketchInput`) and consistent `insert`/`estimate`/`merge` patterns across sketches.
- Built-in framework layer: `Hydra`, `HashLayer`, `ExponentialHistogram`, and `EHUnivOptimized` are included in the same crate.
- Optimization hooks for Rust workloads: shared-hash fast paths and pluggable hashing via `SketchHasher`.

When DataSketches may be a better fit:

- You need its broader algorithm catalog and long-running production maturity.
- You need direct compatibility with existing DataSketches deployments across Java/C++/Python ecosystems.
